# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a Pomodoro Timer built with React. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Here I've created two break modes. The breaks are of 15 mins and 3 mins.
